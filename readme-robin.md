Assistive Technologies:

The call to action in the index was going to be a h3 tag, but read that it can be confusing for assistive readers if headings do not go in order. As such, I will style it with a unique ID.

Also, avoidance of all-cap headings. Instead, I have used CSS stying to create all-cap headings.

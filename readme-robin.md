Navigation and meetup section are taken in part from the Love Running sample project.

Images

"About Us" images are placed as background images in CSS as decorative images go into CSS while images in HTML are for content. Subsequently, images on the "Irish made games" section are in HTML.

playtest-dublin-logo is a bespoke design. Provided in svg with a jpg fallback for compatability.

Assistive Technologies:

The call to action in the index was going to be a h3 tag, but read that it can be confusing for assistive readers if headings do not go in order. As such, I will style it with a unique ID.

Also, avoidance of all-cap headings. Instead, I have used CSS stying to create all-cap headings.
